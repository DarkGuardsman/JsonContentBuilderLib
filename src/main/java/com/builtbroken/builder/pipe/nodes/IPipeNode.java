 * Single step in a pipe. Can be though of as an action.

 * When building your node and placing it in the pipe take time to understand
 * the input and output of other nodes. There is an expectation that a previous
 * node will generate the input needed by the next node/pipe. If your object
 * needs a JSON and the next needs an array. Then its important to match it or place
 * your node in a different location.
 * <p>
 * Optionally you can skip doing work on the passed in object but this is messy.
 * As it could indicate an error with the pipe if you received something unexpected.
